<h2>Reviews</h2>

<ul style="color:white; font-size:120%">

		<li>What a find! I was looking for sushi places near The HUB Seattle and found them. I did not have high expectations, and was blown away by the quality of the sushi and authenticity of the place. Having eaten in many similar small sushi places in Tokyo and Osaka, I can say with confidence that Tsukshinbo will not disappoint you.

		<li>Sit at the bar, enjoy friendly banter and watch a fantastic slicing and dicing show! The omakase is great, especially for sashimi. All the sushi is wonderful, excellent fresh fish very well prepared. Lots of wonderful small plates, as authentic as it gets. I get the deep fried mochi (agemochi) every time. Newly redesigned interior is a nice enhancement. It's a very casual, lively atmosphere which can get a crowded at peak times--perfect for enjoying another tall Sapporo and plenty of laughs with friends. Or for a lunchtime treat with co-workers, clients or anyone else you can use as an excuse to expense an awesome meal!
